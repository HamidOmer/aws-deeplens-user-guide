When your AWS DeepLens device is registered and connected, you can begin using it\. To use your device for deep learning, you create a project and deploy it to your AWS DeepLens device\. An AWS DeepLens *project* is made up of deep learning models and associated AWS Lambda functions\.

AWS DeepLens comes with several sample projects that you can deploy and use right out of the box\.
