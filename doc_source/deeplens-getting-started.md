# Getting Started with AWS DeepLens<a name="deeplens-getting-started"></a>

Before using AWS DeepLens, you must set up your AWS DeepLens application development environment, register your AWS DeepLens device, connect your  computer to the device Wi\-Fi network, configure the device settings, and verify the device connection status\. To accomplish these, you perform some of the tasks on the AWS Management console for AWS DeepLens \(aka, the AWS DeepLens console\) and perform others on the AWS DeepLens device\.

The following graphic shows where you perform each step\.

 To use AWS DeepLens after the device is successfully registered and connected to the AWS cloud, you'll use the AWS console to create a project and deploy it to the device\. When the project is running, you can view the project result by opening a web browser and navigating to the device's local IP address \(on port 4000\)\.
