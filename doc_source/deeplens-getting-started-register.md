# Register Your AWS DeepLens Device<a name="deeplens-getting-started-register"></a>

To run your deep learning computer vision application on your AWS DeepLens device, you must first register the device with AWS\. After the registration, you can create an AWS DeepLens project on the AWS Cloud, deploy the project to the registered device, and update the device software and settings\. 

The registration process involves performing the following tasks\. Some of the tasks are carried out on the AWS Cloud and others are on the AWS DeepLens device\.
+ Name your device so that you can identify it within the AWS DeepLens service\. 
+ Grant IAM permissions to build and deploy AWS DeepLens projects for deep learning computer vision applications\. 
+ Download a security certificate for the device\. This certificate is generated by AWS IoT upon request by the AWS DeepLens service\. You must upload it to the device when setting up the device later\.
+ Create an AWS IoT thing representation for your AWS DeepLens device, which is carried out by AWS Greengrass upon request by the AWS DeepLens service\.
+ Turn on the device's setup mode and join your computer in the device's local Wi\-Fi \(also referred to as `AMDC-NNNN`\) network\. This lets you call the device setup app as a web application hosted by the local web server of the device\.
+ Start the device setup application on the device to configure device access to internet; to upload the AWS\-generated security certificate to the device for the AWS Cloud to authenticate the device; and to create a device login password for signing in to the device using a hardwired monitor, mouse and keyboard or using an SSH client from a computer within the same home or office network\.

 Before registering your device, make sure that you have met all the requirements discussed in [Set Up Your AWS DeepLens Development Environment](deeplens-prerequisites.md)\. 

The detailed instructions to register your AWS DeepLens device are given in the following topics\.
