**Important**  
Attach the roles exactly as described\. Otherwise, you might have trouble deploying models to AWS DeepLens\.
If any of the lists do not have the specified role, find that role in step 4, follow the directions to create the role, choose **Refresh IAM roles**, and return to where you were in step 5\.

   After the certificate has been downloaded, choose **Register**\.
**Important**  
The certificate is a \.zip file\. You attach it to AWS DeepLens in \.zip format, so donâ€™t unzip it\.   
Certificates aren't reusable\. You need to generate a new certificate every time you register your device\.
