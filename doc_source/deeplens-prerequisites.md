Before you can begin using AWS DeepLens, you need an AWS account and an IAM user\. 

## Create an AWS Account<a name="deeplens-create-aws-account"></a>

To use AWS services, you need an AWS account\. If you don't have one, create one now\. 

The AWS account is free\. You pay only for the AWS services that you use\.

**To create an AWS account**

1. Go to [https://portal\.aws\.amazon\.com](https://portal.aws.amazon.com)\.

1. Choose **Create a Free Account**\.

1. Follow the instructions on the page\.

   Part of the sign\-up process involves receiving a phone call and entering a PIN using the phone keypad\.

## Create an IAM User<a name="deeplens-create-iam-user"></a>

You use the AWS Identity and Access Management \(IAM\) user to specify to whom the IAM policies and roles apply\.

**Important**  
Record your **Access Key** and **Secret Key**\. You need them to make calls with the AWS CLI\.

**To create an IAM user**

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the IAM console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/iam/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/)\.

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Users**, then choose **Add user**\.

1. For **Access type**, choose both **Programmatic Access** and **AWS Management Console Access**\.

1. For **Console password**, choose **Autogenerated password** or **Custom password**\. If you choose **Custom password**, type a password\.

1. Choose whether to require the user to reset the password at the next sign\-in, then choose **Next: Permissions**\.

1. For **Set permissions for <user name>**, choose **Attach existing policies directly**, **AdministrativeAccess**, and **Next: Review**\.

1. Review the settings\. To return to the previous page to make changes, choose **Previous**\. To create the user, choose **Create user**\.

Now that you have an AWS account and IAM user, continue to [Register Your AWS DeepLens Device](deeplens-getting-started-register.md)\.
