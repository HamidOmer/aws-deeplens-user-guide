# Create and Deploy an AWS DeepLens Project<a name="deeplens-create-deploy-project"></a>

After you have registered and set up your AWS DeepLens device successfully, you need to create an AWS DeepLens project and deploy it to the device\. An AWS DeepLens project consists of a deep learning model and a Lambda function that makes inferences of an input image based on the deep learning model\. 

To help you started quickly, AWS DeepLens provides a set of sample projects with pre\-trained models and tested function templates\. You can use the sample projects as\-is or customize them to fit your application requirements\. After becoming familiar with a sample project, you can explore creating custom project\. For more information, see [Working with AWS DeepLens Projects](deeplens-projects.md)\.

To use a sample project, follow the instructions given in [Creating and Deploying an AWS DeepLens Sample Project](deeplens-create-deploy-sample-project.md)\.
